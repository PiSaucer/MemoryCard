# MemoryCard

*A Git-style version control system for retro game saves.*

## About

**MemoryCard is a local-first, Git-style save manager for retro game playthroughs.** It allows you to capture snapshots of `.sav` files, branch your progress, restore old timelines, and maintain a full history of your games—just like a version control system for emulator saves.

> MemoryCard is **not** a ROM manager, it is a **playthrough history engine**, designed to preserve your story, decisions, and progress across time.
